#Line of Credit

The line of credit is written in Ruby and runs in the command line. Run the "CreditAcount.rb" file in the command line (ruby CreditAccount.rb) or type irb to open up the ruby console and then load the file (load "CreditAccount.rb") to set up your credit account.

- When opening the account, you'll be prompted to make four transactions (payments or withdrawal -- your choice).
- After you've completed the four transaction, your billing statement (with interest) will appear in the console. The billing statement is for 30 seconds
- Can change billing cycle from 30 seconds to 30 days by changing the @start_billing_test and @end_biling_test variables to @start_billing and @end_billing.
